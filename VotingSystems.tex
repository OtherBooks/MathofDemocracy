  \item The Bellevue Taxicab Union is preparing to elect its president. 
        Three members are considering running for president:  Alice, Bob, and Charles.
        Each of the five voters has a first, second, and third choice,
        as listed in the following table:       
           \def\A{Alice}
           \def\B{Bob}
           \def\C{Charles}

            2nd choice: & \C & \A & \C & \A & \A \\
            3rd choice: & \B & \C & \A & \B & \C \\
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        Depending on who decides to run, the ballot the voters see in the booth will look different.
        For each of the following ballots, how many votes will each candidate receive?  Who will win?

  \item The AP college football poll is a ranking of the top 25 college football teams in the country and is one of the key polls used for the BCS\footnote{Bowl Championship Series}. The voters in the AP poll are a group of sportswriters and broadcasters chosen from across the country. The top 25 teams are ranked using a Borda count: each first-place vote is worth 25 points, each second-place vote is worth 24 points, each third-place vote is worth 23 points, and so on. The following table shows the ranking and total points for each of the top three teams at the end of the 2006 regular season. (The remaining 22 teams are not shown here because they are irrelevant to this exercise.)

		\solution*{Hint: Since Ohio State was the unanimous first-place choice and we are told the other 22 teams are irrelevant, then we can assume that all the second and third place votes went either to Ohio State or Michigan.  This also means that the voters who didn't put Ohio State second placed them third.  This is all the information you need to solve the problem.}

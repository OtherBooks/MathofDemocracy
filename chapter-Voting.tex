\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Bellevue Taxicab Union is preparing to elect its president. 
        Three members are considering running for president:  Alice, Bob, and Charles.
        Each of the five voters has a first, second, and third choice,
        as listed in the following table:       
           \def\A{Alice}
           \def\B{Bob}
           \def\C{Charles}
        \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}{l||l|l|l|l|l}
            Voter: & Voter 1 & Voter 2 & Voter 3 & Voter 4 & Voter 5 \\ \hline\hline
            1st choice: & \A & \B & \B & \C & \B \\
            2nd choice: & \C & \A & \C & \A & \A \\
            3rd choice: & \B & \C & \A & \B & \C \\
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        Depending on who decides to run, the ballot the voters see in the booth will look different.
        For each of the following ballots, how many votes will each candidate receive?  Who will win?

  \item The AP college football poll is a ranking of the top 25 college football teams in the country and is one of the key polls used for the BCS\footnote{Bowl Championship Series}. The voters in the AP poll are a group of sportswriters and broadcasters chosen from across the country. The top 25 teams are ranked using a Borda count: each first-place vote is worth 25 points, each second-place vote is worth 24 points, each third-place vote is worth 23 points, and so on. The following table shows the ranking and total points for each of the top three teams at the end of the 2006 regular season. (The remaining 22 teams are not shown here because they are irrelevant to this exercise.)
  \begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\hline
Team & Points \\\hline
1. Ohio State & 1625 \\\hline
2. Florida & 1529 \\\hline
3. Michigan & 1526 \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item  Given that Ohio State was the unanimous first-place choice of all the voters, find the number of voters that participated in the poll.
	\solution*{\fbox{65}}\vfill
	
	\item Find the number of second and third-place votes for Florida.
		\solution*{Hint: Since Ohio State was the unanimous first-place choice and we are told the other 22 teams are irrelevant, then we can assume that all the second and third place votes went either to Ohio State or Michigan.  This also means that the voters who didn't put Ohio State second placed them third.  This is all the information you need to solve the problem.}

	Weighted voting systems are when there are $n$ voters labeled $P_1\dots P_n$, and each voter casts a vote with a certain weight, $w_i$.  Think of this as having each voter being able to cast $w_i$ votes all for the same decision.  In order for a motion to pass, the sum of all the votes needs to be at least $q$, the quota.  We need the quota to be more than 50\% of the sum of all the votes and no more than the sum of all the votes, but it can be anything in between.  We give a weighted voting system as 
	$[q|w_1,w_2,\dots,w_n]$.

          Calculate the Shapley-Shubik Power Index for the voters with veto power.  What do you notice?

	\item In some cities the city Council operates under what is known as the, ``strong -- mayor''. Under this system the city Council can pass a motion under a simple majority, but the mayor has the power to veto the decision. The mayor's veto can then be overruled by a ``super majority''  \index{super majority} of the council members. As an example, consider the city of Ice-n-knock.  In Ice-n-knock, the city Council has four members plus a strong mayor who has a vote as well as the power to veto motion supported by a simple majority of the council members. On the other hand, the mayor cannot veto a motion supported by all four Council members. Thus, a motion can pass if the mayor +2 or more Council members supported or, alternatively, if the mayor is against it at the four council members support it. 
	
	It makes sense that under these rules, the four council members have the same amount of power, but the mayor has more. Compute the Shapley-Shubik Power Index of this weighted voting system to figure out exactly how much more.
	
	\ifsolns Focus on the last sentence. A motion can pass if the mayor +2 or more Council members supported or, alternatively, if the mayor is against it at the four council members support it. The Mayor is pivotal whenever they are in the third or fourth position in a sequential coalition.  There are 4! of each of these sequential coalitions. So -- there are a total of 5!=120 total sequential coalitions.  The Mayor is pivotal in $2\times 4! = 48$ of them. Each council member is pivotal in $\frac{120-48}{4}=18$ of them. The Mayor has power of 40\% and each Council member has a power of 15\%.
	\fi
	\vfill
	
	For purposes of comparison, calculate the Banzhaf power distribution of Ice-n-knock.
	\ifsolns This will probably not happen.  But, there are winning coalitions of 3, 4, and 5 players.  The 5 member coalition has no critical members.  There are 5 4-member coalitions.  4 of them have the Mayor as a member and they are the only critical member of those coalitions.  The fifth, without the Mayor, each member is critical. There are 6 3-member winning coalitions that contain the Mayor.  All members are critical in each of these coalitions. So, the Mayor is critical in $4+6=10$ places.  The total number of critical council members is $4 + 6*2=16$ places.  Thus, our denominator is 26, the Mayor's numerator is 10 and each Council member's numerator is 4.  The Mayor has power of 38.5\% and each Council member has a power of 15.4\%. \fi
